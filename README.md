# Composable App System

This is an experiment to explore whether we can create highly composable and configurable systems for creating apps.

The ultimate goals is being able to build apps using a GUI to compose "building blocks", define navigation routes, connect dynamic dataSources and more.

The inspiration for this project was a video that showed a VR user interface for creating wires to connect nodes. The wires were created using particles to visualise different things.

I can imagine seeing all of the pages and routes in an app laid out in front of you and being able to visualise a bunch of things:

* Performance - where are the errors, intensive operations, failing requests, etc.
* Analytics - where are users entering and exiting, what are the pageviews, events, etc.
* Architecture - what are the navigation flows, where are we connected to external sources, etc.
